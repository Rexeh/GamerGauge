GamerGauge
=============

Welcome to the GITHUB repository for www.gamergauge.co.uk, the only rating system for online gaming communities!

This is to serve as a bug/feature tracker for the project.


### What is it?
We're all so used to rating online games out of 10, but the majority of games we play these days are based around online play which means interacting with others.

We don't focus on what others are doing, we focus purely on allowing you to rate the games you love in terms of their online community. Is the game fun to play online? That is what we're seeking to measure.
